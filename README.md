# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging two-player strategy game.
It is played on a 3x3 grid where each player takes turns marking a cell with their symbolâ€”'X' or 'O'. The objective of the game is to align three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal while preventing your opponent from doing the same.
